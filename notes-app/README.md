# Notes App using outside API

### To run react App
```
npm start
```

### To run json server
```
npm run server
```

### Note: If you're encountering issues with port 3001 being occupied on your localhost, consider the following solutions:

Change the Port: Modify the start script in your package.json file to use a different port number. For example, replace 3001 with 3002.
Also change the port no. from 3001 to 3002 in the code too where API requests are made
